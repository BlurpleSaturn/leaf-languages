# **Leaf-Languages**

> Welcome to the official repository for Leaf's languages based on community translations!

 Leaf-Languages is a project that aims to make Leaf Bot more accessible to non-English speaking communities. By contributing to this repository, you can help translate the bot's content into different languages.

## **How to Contribute**

 To contribute to the project, simply copy the ``english.json`` file and translate its contents. Then, create a new file with the name of your language (e.g. danish.json). Once you have translated the contents of the file, create a pull request to add your language to the bot.

 Please note that this repository is a work in progress and will be updated later on. Your contributions are greatly appreciated, and will help us make Leaf Bot accessible to more people around the world.
